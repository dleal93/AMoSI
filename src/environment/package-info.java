/**
 * This package defines the entire environment of the simulation. <br>
 * The simulation's context is defined by a {@linkplain SimBuilder} class in which all agents are created and inserted in the context. <br>
 * The {@linkplain GoodsMarket} and {@linkplain LaborMarket} classes are entities in the environment <b>used</b> by the agents. <br>
 * The {@linkplain StatisticsManager} gathers data and performs operations to provide a set of macro-economic outcomes.
